<h1>Generating a Graphical Scene with Java</h1>
<p>
    This program creates a 3D graphical scene by simulating light interactions with various objects and materials. 
    The user can define custom light sources, objects, and their properties to build realistic scenes that mimic 
    real-world phenomena like reflection and refraction.
</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Custom Light Sources:</strong> Define and position objects that simulate light sources within the scene.</li>
    <li><strong>Material Properties:</strong> Assign materials to objects, enabling realistic effects such as reflection, refraction, and shadow.</li>
    <li><strong>3D Scene Generation:</strong> Build and visualize fully customizable 3D scenes with user-defined configurations.</li>
    <li><strong>Realistic Simulations:</strong> Models light behavior to create lifelike scenes based on object and material properties.</li>
</ul>
